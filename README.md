# 👻 Ghost's Plugin Pack 👻

A collection of my personal plugins and edits of existing plugins.

These are based on the Kraken API by [Rune](https://github.com/cbartram/kraken-api).

I am mostly working on these as I level a (currently) F2P account.

##🔌Plugins List
 * Fucken ToA - Overlays based on xKylee's, plans to add automation later.
 * GemCrab - Auto gemcrab so you can afk the afkest combat method ever.
 * Mining - Included from Rune as the example I worked from/referenced, plans to flesh out later.
 * Woodcutting - My first plugin! Just auto woodcuts! Banks/drops, very basic right now.

## 🛠 Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.org/) — Core language
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) — Build tool
* [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) — Used for as the backbone for the API
